üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js (version 16 or higher) and npm installed on your system.

2. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/gita-guidance.git](https://github.com/your-username/gita-guidance.git)
cd gita-guidance

3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required npm packages.

npm install

4. Set Up Your Environment Variables
This project requires an API key from Google AI Studio to connect to the Gemini API.

Create a new file in the root of your project directory called .env.

Open the .env file and add the following line, replacing YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with the key you obtained from Google AI Studio.

VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

Note: Using the VITE_ prefix is important for Vite projects to expose the environment variable to the frontend code.

Finally, you need to update the gita_guidance_app.jsx file to use this environment variable instead of a hardcoded key. Find the lines where apiKey is defined and change them to:

const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY;

This is a more secure way to handle your API key.

5. Run the Application
Start the local development server.

npm run dev

The application should now be running at http://localhost:5173 (or the next available port).
